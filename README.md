# E-Commerence-website-final
Our final project was to create an E-Commerence website taking into account the critiques given to us in class

I coded by hand an E-Commerence website using HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap4 framework. 
Though we didn't need to have a shopping cart we just needed an image of a clickable icon to say 'Pay' for example.

**The site was to be done using Word Press but I wanted to strengthen my coing skills and code it by hand**
